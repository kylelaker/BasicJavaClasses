Rather than having the Java classes that I write be scattered across tons
of Gists, I decided it would be helpful to put them all in one GitHub repo.

These are not put into a particular package or organized. They simply
exist because I wanted to play around with some concept, style, or
algorithm. These should probably never be used in any sort of production
code, but if they fit your needs, feel free to use them.
